# Uranus System - Requirements Elicitation

This project focuses on the requirements elicitation process for the Uranus system, a new social media app. The elicitation technique employed in this paper involved interviewing members of the target audience, specifically a group of college students. The interviews utilized laddering techniques to elicit more data from the participants' personal disclosures. Triading techniques were also employed to reveal deep-seated attitudes, perceptions, and feelings toward the app and its services.

## Objectives

- Gather requirements for the Uranus system using the elicitation technique.
- Conduct interviews with college students to gather insights and data.
- Utilize laddering techniques to elicit personal disclosures and gather more comprehensive data.
- Apply Triading techniques to reveal underlying attitudes, perceptions, and feelings.
- Create a Repertory Grid based on the gathered data.
- Develop a survey based on the elicited requirements and incorporate the survey results into the Repertory Grid statistics.
